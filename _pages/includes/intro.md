I'm Xiaolin Hu, pursuing Ph.D. at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/) <img src='./images/logo-gsai-header-desktop.png' style='width: 8em;'> , Renmin University of China (RUC). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yong Liu](https://liuyonggsai.github.io/). Currently I am a Research Intern at [Xiaomi's AI Lab](https://www.mi.com/miai) <img src='./images/mi-logo.png' style="width: 2.3em;">, where I focus on Edge Large Language Models (LLMs), mentored by [Wei Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-liu-40a97a39/?originalSubdomain=cn) and [Jian Luan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jian-luan-58b5a428/?originalSubdomain=cn). Previously, I received my B.E. and M.E. degrees in communication and information system from Shanghai University in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Between 2018 and 2021, I collaborated with Prof. [Nicholas E. Buris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-buris-a974ba5/) as part of the Intelligent Multi-Input Multi-Output Systems (i-MIMOs) research group. Additionally, I gained research experience as an Intern at the [OPPO Research Institute](https://www.oppo.com/en/proposal/) <img src='./images/oppo-logo.png' style="width: 3.8em;"> from October 2020 to February 2021, under the mentorship of [Xianyue Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wuxianyue/) and [Tehuang Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tehuangliu/?originalSubdomain=cn).

I am currently bridging LLMs and personal edge devices. With a long-term goal of contributing to a human-centered application ecosystem based on large models, I am particularly interested in:

<!-- 
Toward the long vision of building a human-centered application ecosystem based on the fundation models, I am interested in the following topics:  -->
(1) Science-Driven LLMs Training: Exploring the scientific principles of LLMs training and fine-tuning. 
<!-- (1) Science Driven Tuning: to pursue scientific principles behind optimization of LLMs and use them to guide human-centerd personal model development. --> 

(2) Personal Edge LLMs Serving: Developing efficient algorithms for LLMs on edge devices to enhance personalized services.


<!-- to study efficient method for deploying LLMs on edge devices and the communication challenges arising from large-scale agents. to guide human-centered model development  -->

I won the [Shanghai University President Scholarship](https://news.shu.edu.cn/info/1021/47992.htm) (The highest honor among the scholarships at Shanghai University). 

<!-- I have a signal processing background, my current research interests include the theory and methods of Federated Learning and Optimization. -->

<!-- Her research expertise includes developing methods and tools to integrate AI with science, especially for dynamical systems and PDE-based simulations.
